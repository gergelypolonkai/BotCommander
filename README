  (0) NOTICE

    Please read this document, and the original BotCommander documentation
    before asking for help! These files contain almost everything possible, and
    are always growing, as people ask me more and more questions.

     _________________________________________________________________


  (1) WHAT IS BOTCOMMANDER?

    BotCommander is a customisable telnet client, heavily specialized with the
    usage with Eggdrop IRC bots. Currently it possesses only the planned basic
    functionality, but I have many-many plans, such as module-writing,
    scripting and such.

    BotCommander is continously updated: bugs are getting fixed, and new
    features are being added, which sometimes can cause new bugs. Currently
    there is a so called "stable" version out there, but there are still known
    bugs.

  (2) HOW DO I GET BOTCOMMANDER?

    Before you can install/compile BotCommander, you will need several other
    software installed on your machine.

    As BotCommander currently depends heavily on GTK+ 2 and Gnome 2, you will
    need these. If you are planning (or must) install BotCommander from
    sources, you will also need the development libraries of them. These
    software comes with most of the Linux/Unix distributions, so the only thing
    you may have to do is to install them.

    The current stable version (as of writing) is 1.0; you can download it
    (amongst many other files) from http://www.botcommander.hu/.

    Optionally, you can get the latest SVN version from
    http://www.botcommander.hu/files/botcommander-svn.tar.bz2. BUT BEWARE! This
    version may contain code snippets which will never compile on any machine!
    This is because I'm a nasty developer, and sometimes upload this kind of
    code, so I can continue coding on my other machine after an svn update. I'm
    also planning to add anonymous SVN access, but currently I don't have
    enough knowledge about SVN to do such thing.

  (3) QUICK STARTUP

    About installation quick-start you should read the INSTALL file; about
    usage, you should go and read the original BotCommander documentation. The
    latter is written in DocBook XML, and is compiled into a PDF document upon
    a successful installation. It can be found in the doc/ directory.
